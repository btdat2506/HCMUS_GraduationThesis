\section{Conclusion}
% \vspace{-0.1in}
We present Gemmini, a full-stack, open-source generator of DNN accelerators that
enables systematic evaluations of DNN accelerator architectures.
Gemmini leverages a flexible architectural template to capture
different flavors of DNN accelerator architectures.
In addition, Gemmini provides a push-button, high-level software flow to
boost programmers' productivity.
Finally, Gemmini generates a full SoC that runs real-world software stacks
including operating systems, to enable system architects to evaluate
system-level impacts. 
Our evaluation shows that Gemmini-generated accelerators demonstrate high performance efficiency, and  
our case studies show how accelerator designers and system architects can
use Gemmini to co-design and evaluate system-level behavior in emerging applications.
